# A rudimentary analysis of canine sausage-ness

Which sausage dogs are more sausage-y? Using information about dog height and length from [dimensions.com](https://www.dimensions.com/collection/dogs-dog-breeds), I explore the ratio of length to height across dog breeds.

The data is stored in [`data.csv`](/data.csv), and it is visualised in the Jupyter notebook [`sausageness.ipynb`](/sausageness.ipynb).

## But why?

After spending two days looking for data that does not exist for another personal project, my mind drifted to the greener pastures of doggo memes.
